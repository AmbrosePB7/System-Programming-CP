# Paging Simulation in Java

# Project Overview
This project simulates the paging memory management technique used by modern operating systems. It includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, allowing users to interactively simulate the translation of logical addresses to physical addresses and observe the occurrence of page faults. The simulation demonstrates how pages of a process are loaded into memory frames and how the system responds when a page fault occurs.

# Features
Logical to Physical Address Translation: Simulates the conversion of logical addresses to physical addresses using paging.

Page Fault Handling: Simulates how the system loads pages into memory and replaces existing pages when necessary.

GUI Interface: A user-friendly interface where users can input process and page sizes, access memory, and observe the state of the memory frames and page table in real-time.

Interactive Simulation: Displays memory access logs, updates to memory frames, and page table information dynamically as the simulation runs.

# Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language used for implementing the simulation.

Java Swing: Used to create the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive user input and visual output.
